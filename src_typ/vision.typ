target Valeriy Sakharov is a trader worth 25M\$

#wrap(
  image("./assets/MartinSchmid.jpg", width: 30%),
)[
world-class at building accurate predictions; updates them fast and accurately when new relevant information comes out; which he has systems to track, for each of the outstanding positions. PhD-level at math; has made academic contributions on ideas introduced in Martin Schmid's papers, and on general RM solutions. Loves reading scientific papers. Does focus-meditation to train ability to deep-work in isolation. Is good at prioritization, doesn't get tempted into starting with tasks that look easy. Embrasses #link("https://youtu.be/YC4T3g7QP5w?si=QkNuh2Sb1KKh0l-Q")[contradiction].
]

casually swings deci-million positions; but very careful about the risk-management. Prefers to pyramid in when right; risking only existing profit whenever possible. Able to size the trades quickly and precisely, due to weekly playing poker at a high level.

has automatic rm systems, removing the need to worry about psychology. Doesn't have to worry about slippage, as algorthims are in-place to regulate that. His quant hedge-fund Liquid Alpha employes 6 people, including 1 math PhD; with practically 0 churn, as #link("https://www.instagram.com/p/DRsoKzhETqG/")[he ensures that every employee can achieve his goals within the organization]. Is #link("https://youtu.be/KZSXFPt4Vqk")[mindful of entropy], - hiring only prospects above average level on the team.
]

he is ruthlessly pain-seeking, only pursuing delayed gratification. Deep work is the most rewarding experience for him.

  Goes there for 1-2 weeks yearly; planning the life for the next year, in semi-seclusion
- owns a 10k Rolex, but prefers wearing Casio over it


== fitness
can do all of:
- planche
- front-lever
- 1+ one-arm pull-up on each hand
- hand-stand pushups

// additional indicators of fitness could be: {visible abs, bicep vein, etc}, but I'm pretty sure the perf-based metrics above already force all the cosmetics in order; while also being actionable.

== family
#wrap(
  image("./assets/Priscilia.png", width: 32%),
)[
married to someone who increases his productive output /*(likely Priscilia)*/. No kids yet, but is in a position to easily provide for them if needed.

Besides being in such arrangement, keeps strict rules about what food and other temptations can physically be in the house (or in reach). Is very careful about reinforcement rules for himself and everyone he often comes in contact with.

== target beliefs
/*
section where I list beliefs that need to be updated.

to compile, - list all the beliefs/opinions/feelings that have prevented you from having had achieved the goal already. 
*/
for each of these, imagine a picture where the statement is true, and you have a good feeling in relation to it.

- math is one of the most fun things I can do, beating any other leasurely activity
- excruciatingly analyzing and recording my trades, then comparing tiniest of similarities on history, is one of the most rewarding things to do.
- I love managing people
- as a business owner, I love that problems, that end up on my table, are the most difficult ones that business has to offer

== habits to establish
- note down distractions (that successfully diverted your attention away from work)
- prioritize hardest task in todo lists // currently don't do any prioritization once a list is constructed, - just going off of what feels right. And what feels right is what is easy atm. So I end up working on often much less relevant stuff.
