= vision
target Valeriy Sakharov is a trader worth 25M\$

world-class at building accurate predictions; updates them fast and accurately when new relevant information comes out; which he has systems to track, for each of the outstanding positions. PhD-level at math; has made academic contributions on ideas introduced in Martin Schmid's papers, and on general RM solutions. Loves reading scientific papers. Does focus-meditation to train ability to deep-work in isolation.

casually swings deci-million positions; but very careful about the risk-management. Prefers to pyramid in when right; risking only existing profit whenever possible. Able to size the trades quickly and precisely, due to weekly playing poker at a high level.

has automatic rm systems, removing the need to worry about psychology. Doesn't have to worry about slippage, as algorthims are in-place to regulate that. His quant hedge-fund Liquid Alpha employes 6 people, including 1 math PhD; with practically 0 churn, as #link("https://www.instagram.com/p/DRsoKzhETqG/")[he ensures that every employee can achieve his goals within the organization].
]

he is ruthlessly pain-seeking, only pursuing delayed gratification. Deep work is the most rewarding experience for him.

== fitness
can do all of:
- planche
- front-lever
- 1+ one-arm pull-up on each hand
- hand-stand pushups

// additional indicators of fitness could be: {visible abs, bicep vein, etc}, but I'm pretty sure the perf-based metrics above already force all the cosmetics in order

married to someone who increases his productive output /*(likely Priscilia)*/. No kids yet, but is in a position to easily provide for them if needed.

Besides being in such arrangement, keeps strict rules about what food and other temptations can physically be in the house (or in reach). Is very careful about reinforcement rules for himself and everyone he often comes in contact with.

Continues Andrey's legacy. With very stable profits on 25M\$ of capital; it is on track to continue growing exponentially.

- math is one of the most fun things I can do, beating any other leasurely activity
- excruciatingly analyzing and recording my trades, then comparing tiniest of similarities on history, is one of the most rewarding things to do.

== habits to establish
- note down distractions (that successfully diverted your attention away from work)
